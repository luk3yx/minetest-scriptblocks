# rmod
RMod mod for Minetest with various cool nodes.

Conveyors
-

Conveyors are nodes that can carry entities, such as players and items. There are a few bugs with it, but it works fine for the most part.

Crates
-

Crates are like chests, but you can pick them up with the items inside. As a result, you can also stack crates indefinitely.

Grates
-

Grates are nodes which let water flow through, but not players or items.
